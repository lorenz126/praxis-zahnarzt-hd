        "question": "Does health insurance cover the costs?",

        "question": "Is the treatment painful?",
        "answer": "Professional teeth cleaning is usually pain-free. In case of sensitive teeth or exposed tooth necks, local anesthesia can be used."

      {
        "question": "What is pregnancy prophylaxis?",
